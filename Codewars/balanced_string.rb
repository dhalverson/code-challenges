# A string is called balanced when every letter occuring in the string, appears both in upper and lowercase. For example the string 'CATattac' is balanced ('a','c', and 't' occur in both cases), but 'Madam' is not. Note the number of occurrences does not matter.

# Write a function that given a string S of length N, returns the length of the shortest balanced fragment of S. If S does not contain any balanced fragments, the function should return -1

# Examples:
# 1. Given S = 'azABaabza' the function should reutrn 5. The shortest balanced fragment of S is 'ABaab'
